#Chitchat
Chitchat is a simple chat box built using vuejs, nodejs and redis (node-redis)

To require this client version, you can simple add the following to your pacakge.json file:

"chitchat": "https://github.com/dv9io0o/chitchat"

You can then add the src/chitchat.js npm module to your page and create a vue template however you'd like (See examples for some simple implementations)

You must also install the chitchat-node repo onto a server which has node and redis installed.

#SERVER
